## Bringing material design

Material design is the guidelines of Google bor a better web experience. You can bring it to life in your project with several library named material -"name of your framework". For me it was <a href="https://vuematerial.io/">Vue material</a> . I also mix some component from <a href="https://demos.creative-tim.com/vue-material-dashboard/#/dashboard">vue material dashboard</a>  and the result is here
